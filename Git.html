<h1 id="joshs-introduction-to-git">Josh’s Introduction to Git</h1>
<p>In modern software development and documentation, the version control
system <em>git</em> is most often used for source control. This system
is based on two concepts: repositories and branches. A
<em>repository</em>, also known as a <em>repo</em>, is a collection of
files. A <em>branch</em> is a version of those files that can be edited
independently of other versions of those files. A repo holds one or more
branches. Often, though, it contains many branches, allowing different
users to edit, delete, and add to different branches at the same time
without overwriting other users’ work.</p>
<p>Since each developer (and writer) contains a copy of the repo on
their local machine (a <em>local repo</em>), they edit the <em>local
branches</em> in these repos without requiring network access. When a
developer is ready to share their work with other users, they upload
their local branch to a repo accessible by the other users, the
<em>remote repo</em>, which contains <em>upstream branches</em>.
Developers frequently download and upload work from the remote repo. In
this way, many different developers can work independently while sharing
their work when it is complete.</p>
<h2 id="commits-the-building-blocks-of-git">Commits: the building blocks
of git</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, repos contain branches, which are different
versions of the files in the repo. Git stores the information about
branches in <em>commits</em>. When a user alters the files in a branch
and then wants to save those changes in the git repo, the user
<em>commits</em> those changes. This results in a commit, which contains
the list of files changed, and the exact changes to those files since
they were last committed. Commits do not contain the files in the repo.
Instead, each commit only contains the changes to the branch since the
last time files in it were committed. The changes from one commit to
another is referred to as the <em>diff</em> between those two commits,
and git can compute and show you the diff between any two commits in a
repository – not just a commit that occurred directly after another
commit. By viewing diffs, you can see how your project has evolved from
any point to any other point in time.</p>
<p>Each commit is based on one or more previous commits. When a commit
is based on a single commit, the latest commit updates a branch that
contains the previous commit. When the commit is based on multiple
commits, this is the result of two branches <a
href="#git-merge">merging</a>.</p>
<p>While we often use branches, because they are usually easier to refer
to than referring to commits, each branch is fundamentally a collection
of ordered commits, since each commit is based off of one or more
ancester commits. Git computes the diff from the very first commit in
the branch to the current state of the branch – the <em>tip</em> of the
branch – when you view or edit a branch. This diff includes the total
changes in the branch to all of the files in the repo, including
additions and deletions within files, and additions and deletions of
entire files, too.</p>
<h2 id="basic-operations">Basic operations</h2>
<p>While git provides many commands and options, you will use the
following operations repeatedly:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#git-push"><code>git push</code></a>: Uploads changes from
a local branch to an upstream branch.</li>
<li><a href="#git-fetch"><code>git fetch</code></a>: Downloads
information from a remote repo about the current state of its
branches.</li>
<li><a href="#git-merge"><code>git merge</code></a>: Inserts material
from one branch into another branch.</li>
<li><a href="#git-pull"><code>git pull</code></a>: Performs
<code>git fetch</code> and then performs a <code>git merge</code> from
the upstream branch into your local branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections briefly describe each of these operations. For
more detailed options for each of these operations, please see the <a
href="https://git-scm.com/doc">official git documentation online</a>.
Also, note that in the following sections, we assume that you have set
up your local branches to track upstream branches. For more information
on setting up tracking branches, see <a
href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/track-remote-upstream-branch/">this
page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="git-push"><code>git push</code></h3>
<p><code>git push</code> uploads changes from your local branch to the
upstream branch so that they are identical. Since the upstream branch is
in the remote repo (which other users have access to), using
<code>git push</code> shares your work with everyone who has access to
the remote repo. Note that this operation requires your local branch to
contain all of the commits that the remote branch contains
<em>before</em> running <code>git push</code>, and will fail if this
condition is not met. If the remote branch contains commits that your
local branch does not yet contain, you have two options: (a) first run
<a href="#git-pull"><code>git pull</code></a>, or (b) first run <a
href="#git-fetch"><code>git fetch</code></a> followed by <a
href="#git-merge"><code>git merge</code></a>. After doing (a) or (b),
you can run <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> To upload changes from your local branch
<code>hotfix</code> to the upstream branch <code>hotfix</code> in the
remote repo named <code>origin</code>, run</p>
<pre><code>git push origin hotfix</code></pre>
<h3 id="git-fetch"><code>git fetch</code></h3>
<p><code>git fetch</code> downloads information about the current state
of the remote repository, including all of the new commits and branches
it contains. This operation is always safe to run, however, because it
does not <em>change</em> your local branch. To update your local branch
with changes in the upstream branch, first run <code>git fetch</code>
and then run <a href="#git-merge"><code>git merge</code></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> To download information from the remote
repository named <code>origin</code>, run</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin</code></pre>
<h3 id="git-merge"><code>git merge</code></h3>
<p><code>git merge</code> compares two branches and updates one of them
with changes that the other one contains. This operation can be used to
update one branch with information from any other branch, including
upstream branches and local branches.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> To update the local branch
<code>master</code> with changes in the upstream branch
<code>hotfix</code>, first switch to <code>master</code> by running</p>
<pre><code>git switch master</code></pre>
<p>and then execute the merge by running</p>
<pre><code>git merge hotfix</code></pre>
<h3 id="git-pull"><code>git pull</code></h3>
<p>Frequently you will want to perform a a <a
href="#git-fetch"><code>git fetch</code></a> immediately followed by a
<a href="#git-merge"><code>git merge</code></a>, which is exactly what
<code>git pull</code> does. The advange of first performing a
<code>git fetch</code> and <em>then</em> performing a
<code>git merge</code> is that you can run <code>git status</code>
between those two operations to determine whether or not running
<code>git merge</code> will result in a merge conflict. (A merge
conflict occurs during <code>git merge</code> when git cannot
automatically integrate the changes introduced by the merge because the
two branches contain commits that conflict with one another. When a
merge conflict occurs, you must instruct git how to <a
href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_to_resolve_conflicts">resolve
the conflict</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> To update the local branch
<code>master</code> with information from the remote branch
<code>master</code> in the remote repository named <code>origin</code>,
first switch to <code>master</code> by running</p>
<pre><code>git switch master</code></pre>
<p>and then execute the pull by running</p>
<pre><code>git pull origin master</code></pre>
<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>
<p>This introduction to git covered several basic git commands, but
there are many others, as well as many options for each command. By
leveraging additional commands and options, git becomes not just a
version control system but a set of tools that assists in your work. For
instance, git allows you to re-order your work so that it is more
understandable to you and your peers. The system also allows you to do
work that you need temporarily – for instance, importing test files –
and later undo that work by undoing a commit. To fully understand git,
it’s best if you first take the time to understand the <a
href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Reset-Demystified#the-three-trees">three
trees</a>. Once you have a solid understanding of that topic, you may be
interested in learning about these additional git commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git diff</code></li>
<li><code>git switch</code></li>
<li><code>git stash</code></li>
<li><code>git restore</code></li>
<li><code>git revert</code></li>
<li><code>git reset</code></li>
<li><code>git rebase</code></li>
</ul>
